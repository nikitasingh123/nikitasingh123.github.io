### About Me

Hi, I'm Nikita Singh, a final year undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at IIT Kanpur. My interests spans across software development, machine learning, data science and quantitative fields. 
I like to solve various social problems through the use of technology :innocent:. I am an open source developer and have developed various web applications and tools. I am also proficient in competitive coding and have a good hold on the data structures and algorithms concepts.
Recently, I have started exploring the field of data science and machine learning applications. I am currently doing some open source projects based on ML and deep learning. 

But hey I am not just a geek :wink:. I love to play table tennis and badminton. I am also interested in painting, reading interesting novels, cooking and interior decor. I also love spending time with nature and travelling to cool places :stuck_out_tongue:.
